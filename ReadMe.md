The cv that I made does not have my personal information insted I used an invented person called Gordon. 
The target of the user profile is some work related to web programing or something related to BBDD.
The colour palet that I used it is from the adove color web site using the "analog" rule centered on the colour #EBA400. 
For the typography I used Georgia and bold for the titles and for the rest it is in the default.
